amazon s3 client for ngx_lua. 

Implementation of the Amazon signature V4: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/zh_cn/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html. 

# Usage

### To load this library

you need to specify this library's path in ngx_lua's lua_package_path directive. For example:
```nginx
http {
   lua_package_path '/path/to/lua-resty-s3/lib/?.lua;;';
}
```

you use require to load the library into a local Lua variable:
```lua
local stats = require("resty.s3")
```

### Methods

```
-- require package
local awss3 = require "resty.s3"

-- init instance.
local s3 = awss3:new(AWSAccessKeyId, AWSSecretAccessKey, aws_bucket, {timeout=1000*10})

-- get a object. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectGET.html
local ok, response = s3:get(key)

-- get a object. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectHEAD.html
local ok, response = s3:head(key)

-- put a object. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectPUT.html
local ok, response = s3:put(key, value, headers)

-- delete a object. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectDELETE.html
local ok, response = s3:delete(key)

-- delete multi objects. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/multiobjectdeleteapi.html
local ok, response = s3:deletes(keys, quiet)

-- list files. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/v2-RESTBucketGET.html
local ok, files = s3:list(prefix, delimiter, page_size, marker)

-- -- signature-v4. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html
